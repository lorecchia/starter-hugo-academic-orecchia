My research aims to design __simple, efficient algorithms__ for foundational computational challenges arising in a variety of applications, spanning __Theoretical Computer Science, Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimization__. 

The unifying thread behind my works is the use of convex optimization and first-order methods as a generic design framework for both __combinatorial and continuous problems__. This view allows us to combine techniques from discrete and continuous mathematics to yield faster, more interpretable algorithms.
